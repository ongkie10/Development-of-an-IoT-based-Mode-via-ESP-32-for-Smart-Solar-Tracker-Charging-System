# Development-of-an-IoT-based-Mode-via-ESP-32-for-Smart-Solar-Tracker-Charging-System
A Mini  SMART Charging Station that is powered by solar energy with a solar tracking system.

This Research Focuses solely on Solar Powered Chargers that is improved and 
developed with its Iot model based for smart charging systems. Its main objective is to 
develop a portable prototype smart charging system that is capable of determining how 
much power was absorbed through the solar panels which is connected to a third party 
app called BLYNK app which shows how much power is on the battery. It also has a 
solar tracker which tracks the movement of the sunlight to obtain energy with much 
more efficiency.
